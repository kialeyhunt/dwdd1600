            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>On a faraway world, dragons rule the land. <a href="index.html#empires">Ten empires</a> stretch across the continent known as Zurra. For over three millennia, these ten races coexisted in periods of both peace and discord.</p>
        <p>Time has now ebbed into a new era of war, for three of the ten races have effectively vanished. With the rise of this new conflict comes seven dragons destined to find the missing souls and bring balance back to Zurra – but is the prophecy and their powers going to be enough?</p>

            <dd><strong>home:</strong> The Floating City<br>
                <strong>appearance:</strong> smallest dragon of all species, in both height and weight; smooth scales with oversized bumps/ridges along back and belly; circular scale pattern lines body all the way to tail; scales can be paler and pastel shades of white, light gray, blue, or soft green<br>
                <strong>abilities:</strong> mist breath (effects cause drowsiness and sleep); the only species with the ability to walk on clouds; incredible sense of smell; nimble talons capable of handling small, delicate things that most dragons cannot</dd>
                
            <dt><strong><em>FireTeeth</em></strong></dt>
            <dd><strong>home:</strong> Magma Mountain<br>
                <strong>appearance:</strong> thick black scales coat the outermost layer of the body; underbelly and underwings glow softly; compact wings to fit in caves and tighter spaces; scales can be any shade of red, orange, or yellow with lighter colored underbelly<br>
                <strong>abilities:</strong> red-hot liquid lava breath; breathing in smoke does not harm or impair extra tough lungs; internal organs burs just as fiery as a volcano, which stabilizes the body and allows it to endure unimaginable degrees of heat, to the point where it is questioned if there is even a limit; eyes are used to both bright lights and seeing in dim caves: extra eyelid closes to protect eyes when swimming and in bright light, while pupils enlarge to an incredible size when in the dark; bottom of talons have pads that can adhere to any surface, used for scaling rock walls of inner volcano</dd>
                
            <dt><strong><em>SandClaws</em></strong></dt>
            <dd><strong>home:</strong> Sallara Sands<br>
                <strong>appearance:</strong> long body and smooth underbelly like a snake; small but sharp ridges trail the spine, as well as guard each leg and wing; head is protected with helmet-like armor; end of  long tail is green and spiked, like a cactus; scales can be dusky brown, beige, or sandy yellow<br>
                <strong>abilities:</strong> fire breath; can withstand immense heat from the sun; bottoms of feet are covered in special pads to walk on blistering sand, with longer claws made for burrowing; cactus-like tail is most valuable natural weapon; can go long periods of time without eating or drinking (extra fat is stored in tail, similar to a camel’s hump)</dd>
