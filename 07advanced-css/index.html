            <h2>Synopsis</h2>
            <p>On a faraway world, dragons rule the land. <a href="index.html#empires">Ten empires</a> stretch across the continent known as Zurra. For over three millennia, these ten races coexisted in periods of both peace and discord.</p>
        <p>Time has now ebbed into a new era of war, for three of the ten races have effectively vanished. With the rise of this new conflict comes seven dragons destined to find the missing souls and bring balance back to Zurra – but is the prophecy and their powers going to be enough?</p>
